            From Humble Beginnings
          </h3>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-5 leading-loose font-light">
            <p>
              Our story starts in [Year Founded], when a group of friends with a
              common dream decided to turn their passion for gaming into a
              reality. What began in a small garage with a handful of computers
              has since grown into a dynamic studio known for creating immersive
              and groundbreaking games. Despite our growth, weâ€™ve never lost
              sight of our original vision: to create games that captivate,
              challenge, and inspire.
